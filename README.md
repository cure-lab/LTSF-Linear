This repo is the official Pytorch implementation of LTSF-Linear: "[Are Transformers Effective for Time Series Forecasting?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.13504.pdf)".

## Updates

- [2022/08/25] We update our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.13504.pdf) with comprehensive analyses on why existing LTSF-Transformers do not work well on the LTSF problem!
- [2022/08/25] Besides DLinear, we're exicted to add two Linear models to the paper and this repo. Now we have a LTSF-Linear family!
  - Linear: Just one linear layer.
  - DLinear: Decomposition Linear to handle data with trend and seasonality patterns.
  - NLinear: A Normalized Linear to deal with train-test set distribution shifts. See section 'LTSF-Linear' for more details.

## LTSF-Linear

### LTSF-Linear family

![image](pics/Linear.png)
LTSF-Linear is a set of linear models.

- Linear: It is just a one-layer linear model, but it outperforms Transformers.
- NLinear: **To boost the performance of Linear when there is a distribution shift in the dataset**, NLinear first subtracts the input by the last value of the sequence. Then, the input goes through a linear layer, and the subtracted part is added back before making the final prediction. The subtraction and addition in NLinear are a simple normalization for the input sequence.
- DLinear: It is a combination of a Decomposition scheme used in Autoformer and FEDformer with linear layers. It first decomposes a raw data input into a trend component by a moving average kernel and a remainder (seasonal) component. Then, two one-layer linear layers are applied to each component and we sum up the two features to get the final prediction. By explicitly handling trend, **DLinear enhances the performance of a vanilla linear when there is a clear trend in the data.**

Although LTSF-Linear is simple, it has some compelling characteristics:

- An O(1) maximum signal traversing path length: The shorter the path, the better the dependencies are captured, making LTSF-Linear capable of capturing both short-range and long-range temporal relations.
- High-efficiency: As each branch has only one linear layer, it costs much lower memory and fewer parameters and has a faster inference speed than existing Transformers.
- Interpretability: After training, we can visualize weights to have some insights on the predicted values.
- Easy-to-use: LTSF-Linear can be obtained easily without tuning model hyper-parameters.

### Comparison with Transformers

Multivariate Forecasting:

LTSF-Linear outperforms all transformer-based methods by a large margin.

### Efficiency

![image](pics/efficiency.png)
Comparison of method efficiency with Look-back window size 96 and Forecasting steps 720 on Electricity. MACs are the number of multiply-accumulate operations. We use DLinear for comparison, since it has the double cost in LTSF-Linear. The inference time averages 5 runs.

## Getting Started

### Environment Requirements

First, please make sure you have installed Conda. Then, our environment can be installed by:

```shell
conda create -n LTSF_Linear python=3.6.9
conda activate LTSF_Linear
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data Preparation

You can obtain all the nine benchmarks from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZOYpTUa82_jCcxIdTmyr0LXQfvaM9vIy) provided in Autoformer. All the datasets are well pre-processed and can be used easily.

```shell
mkdir dataset
```

**Please put them in the `./dataset` directory**

### Training Example

- In `scripts/`, we provide the model implementation *Dlinear/Autoformer/Informer/Transformer*
- In `FEDformer/scripts/`, we provide the *FEDformer* implementation
- In `Pyraformer/scripts/`, we provide the *Pyraformer* implementation

For example:

To train the **LTSF-Linear** on **Exchange-Rate dataset**, you can use the scipt `scripts/EXP-LongForecasting/Linear/exchange_rate.sh`:

```shell
sh scripts/EXP-LongForecasting/Linear/exchange_rate.sh
```

It will start to train DLinear by default, the results will be shown in `logs/LongForecasting`. You can specify the name of the model in the script. (Linear, DLinear, NLinear)

All scripts about using LTSF-Linear on long forecasting task is in `scripts/EXP-LongForecasting/Linear/`, you can run them in a similar way. The default look-back window in scripts is 336, LTSF-Linear generally achieves better results with longer look-back window as dicussed in the paper.

Scripts about look-back window size and long forecasting of FEDformer and Pyraformer is in `FEDformer/scripts` and `Pyraformer/scripts`, respectively. To run them, you need to first `cd FEDformer` or `cd Pyraformer`. Then, you can use sh to run them in a similar way. Logs will store in `logs/`.

Each experiment in `scripts/EXP-LongForecasting/Linear/` takes 5min-20min. For other Transformer scripts, since we put all related experiments in one script file, directly running them will take 8 hours-1 day. You can keep the experiments you interested in and comment out the others.

### Weights Visualization

As shown in our paper, the weights of LTSF-Linear can reveal some charateristic of the data, i.e., the periodicity. As an example, we provide the weight visualization of DLinear in `weight_plot.py`. To run the visualization, you need to input the model path (model_name) of DLinear (the model directory in `./checkpoint` by default). To obtain smooth and clear patterns, you can use the initialization we provided in the file of linear models.
